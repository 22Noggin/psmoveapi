PS Move API
===========

http://thp.io/2010/psmove/

This is a low-level PS Move library that allows you to control the RGB LEDs and
the rumble function of the controller, as well as read the status of the sensors
(accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometeR) and buttons.

The library is based on Alan Ott's hidapi, and has been tested under Mac OS X.
It works in USB-only mode on Linux (the Linux kernel is missing some patches for
it to work in Bluetooth mode as well).

The PS Move protocol information is based on the linmctool and Move On PC
projects.
