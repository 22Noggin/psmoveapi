PS Move API
===========

A cross-platform C library for using the Sony Playstation Move Motion
Controller, with bindings for Python, Java, Qt and others.

The library is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux (USB and Bluetooth).

Basic features:

 * Set the RGB LED color and rumble intensity (USB and Bluetooth)
 * Read digital buttons, analog trigger and sensors (Bluetooth only)

Advanced features:

 * Tracking: Controller tracking with a camera using OpenCV
 * Calibration: Reading of normalized/calibrated values
 * Orientation: Rotation tracking using gyro and accelerometer

Minimal build dependencies on Ubuntu:

  build-essential
  cmake
  libudev-dev
  libbluetooth-dev


Environment variables:

 PSMOVE_TRACKER_CAMERA

     If set, this is the camera that will be used when using
     psmove_tracker_new() instead of using auto-detection

   Example: export PSMOVE_TRACKER_CAMERA=2  # Will use the 3rd camera

 PSMOVE_TRACKER_FILENAME

     If set, this will use a video file to playback instead of
     capturing from a camera. Any camera settings are ignored.

   Example: export PSMOVE_TRACKER_FILENAME=demo.avi # Will play demo.avi

 PSMOVE_TRACKER_ROI_SIZE

     If set, this controls the size of the biggest (initial) ROI that will
     be used to track the controller. Bigger means slower in general, but
     recovery from tracking loss might be faster.

   Example: export PSMOVE_TRACKER_ROI_SIZE=200

 PSMOVE_TRACKER_WIDTH, PSMOVE_TRACKER_HEIGHT

     If set, these variables control the desired size of the camera picture.

   Example: export PSMOVE_TRACKER_WIDTH=1280
            export PSMOVE_TRACKER_HEIGHT=720



The PS Move protocol information is based on information from the the linmctool
and Move On PC projects.

Bindings to the API using C# / Unity are available in "bindings/unity". They
can be used to create application in the Unity Framework. This project has been
contributed by the Copenhagen Game Collective (thanks to Douglas Wilson et al)
and has its own homepage at:
