PS Move API
===========

The PS Move API provides three different APIs for accessing the PS Move Motion
Controller via USB or Bluetooth. The most basic API is the C API, which allows
you to write applications targetting the PS Move controller in C. Based on that,
two high-level APIs exist: A Python binding, which allows developers to quickly
prototype applications and script behavior using Python, and a C++ library using
the Qt Framework. In addition to allowing developers to interface with the PS
Move controller from C++, the C++ library includes annotations and extensions
that are needed to utilize the PS Move controller from within the declarative
user interface description language QML.

The library is available for Mac OS X (both USB and Bluetooth) and Linux (only
USB for now, as the hidraw implementation in the Linux kernel is missing some
features that will hopefully land in a future kernel version). Thanks to the
cross-platform hidapi library on which the PS Move API is based, a port to the
Windows operating system should be possible, but was out of scope for this
project.

Features include:

 * Setting the RGB LED color and rumble intensity (USB and Bluetooth)
 * Read the status of the digital buttons (Bluetooth only)
 * Read the status of the analog trigger (Bluetooth only)
 * Read sensor values for the accelerometer and gyroscope (Bluetooth only)

The library also includes several examples in C, Python and C++ (Qt). A Test
GUI has been developed to test the library features without having to write any
code at all, and to serve as an example for developing custom solutions. A QML
movie trailer browser was also developed as part of the project to demonstrate
the possibilities of using the trigger and gyroscope for navigation gestures.

The PS Move protocol information is based on information from the the linmctool
and Move On PC projects.
