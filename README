PS Move API
===========

A cross-platform C library for using the Sony Playstation Move Motion
Controller, with bindings for Python, Java, Qt and others.

The library is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux (USB and Bluetooth).

Basic features:

 * Set the RGB LED color and rumble intensity (USB and Bluetooth)
 * Read digital buttons, analog trigger and sensors (Bluetooth only)

Advanced features:

 * Tracking: Controller tracking with a camera using OpenCV
 * Calibration: Reading of normalized/calibrated values
 * Orientation: Rotation tracking using gyro and accelerometer


 |- Windows notes ----------- -- -  -
 | If you are using MinGW from the Qt SDK, you have to replace the file
 | libbthprops.a in mingw\lib\ with the file of the same name from the
 | mingw-w64 package. A modified set of Bluetooth headers can be found in
 | external/mingw-w64-headers if you need them - they are taken from the
 | mingw-w64 distribution and have been modified to work with Qt SDK's mingw.
 |
 | If for some reason, you get an assertion error (hFind != NULL) on Windows
 | with psmovepair, it could be that you are not using the Windows Bluetooth
 | stack. Whatever the reason is, the psmovepair utility accepts a command-line
 | parameter that is the desired host address, so you can still pair the device
 | by figuring out the Bluetooth host address manually and using this as the
 | first parameter when starting psmovepair, e.g.:
 |
 |       psmovepair.exe AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
 |
 | If you have Python 2.7 and Swig (tested with 2.0.4) installed, the Python
 | module will be built and can be used normally. If you want to try out the
 | samples, use the follwing (assuming you built the project in "build/":
 |
 |       set PYTHONPATH=..\build\
 |       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\python27\
 |       python psmove_test.py
 |
 .

The PS Move protocol information is based on information from the the linmctool
and Move On PC projects.

Bindings to the API using C# / Unity are available in "bindings/unity". They
can be used to create application in the Unity Framework. This project has been
contributed by the Copenhagen Game Collective (thanks to Douglas Wilson et al)
