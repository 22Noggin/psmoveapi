You need CMake, SWIG, Qt >= 4.7 and Python's headers to build this.

On Linux, you also need libusb-1.0 and libudev.
On Mac OS X, you need IOKit and CoreFoundation.

The Qt Trailers example also needs Qt Mobility >= 1.1 with its
Declarative Components installed (for Video and Audio playback).
The Qt examples are not built by default (see below).

On a Debian-based system, you can install it like this:

  apt-get install cmake swig python-dev libqt4-dev \
                  libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev \
                  libbluetooth-dev

The hidapi library is imported as Git submodule:

  git submodule init
  git submodule update

Building:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    # If you want to build WITHOUT Qt API / bindings:
    cmake ..
    # If you want to build WITH Qt API / bindings:
    cmake -DPSMOVEAPI_BUILD_QTAPI=on ..
    make

Installing:

    make install
