Here are some files that might be useful for users of the library:

 99-psmove.rules:
 Copy this files to /etc/udev/rules.d/ on Linux machines with udev
 to make sure that the PS Move controller can be accessed via USB
 by any user on the system (otherwise you might get a permission
 problem or you might have to run the application as root).

 bluez-register-psmove:
 This adds the relevant profile and SDP entries to the bluetoothd
 state files in /var/lib/bluetooth/ (bluetoothd mustn't be running)
 so that a PS Move controller (also works for Sixaxis) can connect
 as HID device without problems.
